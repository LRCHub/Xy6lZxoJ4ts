Morbid faces
Their twisted face
You'll live to regret
This, this day
Severing all the doubt
Caustic evil
You, you're, you're nothing but a shadow of yourself
Bring down emotions
A will to resist
Mental, mental distortion
Agony, persists
Violence to aggression
Psy, psychotic madness
Mortal of, of persuasion
A line of, paranoia
Why, white harshness
Believe, believe in destiny
Swallow, swallow the lies
"Resist is part of a pattern of daily routine"
A chance to, to, devise
Tighten the grip
A piece, Alive
So, so bad Eradicate
To test our times,sodomize
No, no, as he climb our soul
Contract emotions
A will to resist
Mental, mental distortion
Agony persists
"Resist is part of a pattern of daily routine"
That all states
They start to construct
Power, power against Power
Where, where. where will it end
Contracting emotions
A will to resist
Mental, mental distortion
Agony, agony persists
Agony
Agony
Morbid, morbid faces
Their twisted face
You, you'll, you'll live to regret this, this day
Caustic overtones
Evil, evil shadow
You're, you're nothing, nothing to me
Bring down emotions
A will to resist
Mental, mental distortion
Agony, agony persists
Mental, mental distortion
Agony, perists
Mental Distortion
Agony, agony, agony persists
Mental, mental distortion
Agony, agony persists
