Okay, before I start anything I have to say
I have to say that I'm undercover
And I am not to appear anywhere okay?
It's between you and me and this group

I have to smile
I have to show
I have to be nice all the time
I have to say hello baby
I have to wake up everyday

I have to write
I have to shout
I have to play records all night
I am in a loop
I am the loop
I have to make up, dress up, show up

I have to smile
I have to show
I have be nice all the time
I have to say hello baby
I have to wake up everyday

Yo

I have to write
I have to shout
I have to play records all night
I am in a loop
I am the loop
I have to make up, dress up, show up

Professional, professional, professional, distortion
Professional, professional, professional, distortion
Professional, professional, professional, distortion

I have to sing
I have to tease
I have to kiss so many cheeks
I got the flav
I got the tricks
I have to put guest on the list

I have no right to complain
I have to pretend to pretend
I have to shine
I have to sign
I have to never trust you blind

Smile, show, write, shout, sing, tease, shine, sign
