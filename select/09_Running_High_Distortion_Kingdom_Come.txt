Here you got your answer
Here you got your rock'n roll
Like the last defender
Letting punches come and go

In a raw dispersion
Like there's no tomorrow
Got no time to borrow

I'm the beat controller
I'm the man you wanna see
Like a heat composer
Spark ignition breaking free

In a raw dispersion
Like there's no tomorrow
Got no time to borrow
